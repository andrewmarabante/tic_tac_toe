# tic_tac_toe
In this project I am going to be creating a tic tac toe game! Pretty self-explanatory so let's get started.

All Done! Sooo... my game logic isn't the most elegant... BUT IT WORKS! and I didn't search anything up as far as logic goes so at least it's authentic and I'm getting used to what I can and can't do with javascript. Game works great, css looks great. I'm content with this one!
